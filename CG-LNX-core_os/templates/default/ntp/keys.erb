# There are four formats for keys. 
# S  Standard format is a  64 bit hex format specified in the DES document. The
#    low order bit of each byte being a parity bit, a la the NBS standard.
# N  This NTP format is a 64 bit hex format specified in the NTP standard.
#    It uses the  high order bit of each byte for parity.  
# A  Ascii format simply encodes a 1-8 character ascii string as a key. 
#    Note that because of the simple tokenizing routine, the characters ' ', 
#    '#', '\t', '\n' and  '\0' can't be used in an ascii key. 
# M  The Key format is a 1-8 character ascii string, using the MD5 
#    authentication scheme.
